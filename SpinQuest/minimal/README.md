# Abstract Modules for $A_{N}$ Extraction

These are some of the abstract modules used for $A_{N}$ extraction. The [OmniFold](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.09107) algorithm is used to correct detector smearing. The [RooFit](https://root.cern/manual/roofit/) framework is used for maximum likelihood estimation.

It is recommended to use the [Fermilab Elastic Analysis Facility](https://eafjupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for running these modules.

## Usage
